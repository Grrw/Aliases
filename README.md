# Aliases

## Config files and whatnot.

* aliases.sh:
A small file with handy aliases and the ability to reference what they do.
Just remember to make an actual alias to it in bashrc

* vim (folder):
Some files for vim management; use them to make symlinks.
Use Vundle as plugin manager and everything should work just fine.
vimrc obviously replaces vimrc. The .vim files go in ~/.vim

* ranger (folder):
Config files for Ranger; use them to make symlinks.
They should all go in ~/.config/ranger
